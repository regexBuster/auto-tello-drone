# auto-tello-drone

## Description
This repo has two files which allow you to control a Tello drone from an interactive terminal and to view video from the drone which has basic facial detection features. After connecting to the wifi the Tello drone puts off you should be able to run the drone.py and then video.py to achive the functionality.
